Phishing Email Analysis Report – Task 2

Subject of the Email:
"URGENT: Your Netflix account will be suspended"

Indicators of Phishing:

- Spoofed Sender**: `support@netflix-billing.com` is NOT the real Netflix domain.
- Urgency**: It says “within 24 hours”, which is meant to scare the user into clicking.
- Fake Link**: The URL is `http://netflix-update.verify-billing.com` which is NOT official.
- Grammar**: No personalization (e.g., “Dear Customer” instead of real name).
- Attachment**: A suspicious invoice was attached in the original version I found.
- Email Header Check**: Used [MxToolbox Header Analyzer](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx) to check IP mismatch and domain spoofing.

Conclusion:
This email uses classic phishing techniques — fake sender, fear tactics, and look-alike domains. This task helped me understand how easy it is to get tricked if you're not careful with links or emails asking for urgent action.
