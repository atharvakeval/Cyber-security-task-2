# Cyber Security Internship – Task 2

Task: Analyze a Phishing Email Sample
What I Did:
For this task, I searched for a sample phishing email online and tried to identify all possible signs that show it's fake or malicious.

Here’s what I looked for:
- Sender’s email address and whether it looked spoofed
- Subject line (it was too urgent)
- Spelling mistakes in the message
- A fake URL hidden behind a legitimate-looking link
- A suspicious attachment (named like “invoice.pdf”)

I also pasted the email headers into an online email header analyzer to spot any red flags like mismatched IPs or domains.
What I Learned:
- How to identify a phishing attempt
- How email spoofing works
- Why email headers are important in investigations
- How attackers use fear, urgency, and fake branding to trick people

This was a really good intro to email threat analysis!
